## Description
AIoT Flying Robot for Smart Agriculture Management is a research project aims at alleviating pest damage on crops in farmland. We considered the population aging concern in Taiwan, and few youngsters devoted to taking care of farmland. The lacks of farming experience can drag the agricultural economics seriously in the future. Therefore, we applied our technical expertise to build IoT infrastructure that connecting environmental monitoring sensor devices with drone application in agriculture. The managers or farmers can monitor the environmental conditions in real-time and launch the farming drones.

In the projects, I worked on the programming of IoT infrastructure, combining all sensor devices through Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP). WAMP allows different device to communicate no matter what programming languages run on devices. Through the developing process, I found out how efficient it is to select the most suitable tools in dealing with this scenario, combining multiple sensing device with just single router not only the expedite the programming, but also make the whole system functionality robust.
