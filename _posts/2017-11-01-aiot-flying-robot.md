# AIoT Flying Robot for Smart Agriculture Management

## Overview
AIoT Flying Robot for Smart Agriculture Management is a research project aims at alleviating pest damage on crops in farmland. We considered the population aging concern in Taiwan, and few youngsters devoted to taking care of farmland. The lacks of farming experience can drag the agricultural economics seriously in the future. Therefore, we applied our technical expertise to build IoT infrastructure that connecting environmental monitoring sensor devices with drone application in agriculture. The managers or farmers can monitor the environmental conditions in real-time and launch the farming drones.
